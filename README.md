[Dr. Neeraj Kumar](https://neerajkumarvaid.weebly.com/) - He develops machine learning algorithms (DL, traditional ML algorithms, Computer Vision, and NLP) to solve research problems at the intersection of computational pathology, medical image analysis, healthcare, and genomic data analysis. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (specializing in machine learning) and is skilled in popular machine/deep learning libraries.

[Ruchika Verma](https://ruchika-verma.weebly.com/) - She develops data-driven solutions using machine and deep learning to solve impactful problems in healthcare and medicine. Her research focus is on developing algorithms for processing multi-parametric radiological and gigantic histopathology images for precision oncology. Currently, she is pursuing Ph.D. at Case Western Reserve University, USA and completed her masters from IIT Guwahati, specializing in statistical signal processing and machine learning.

#### Theoretical concepts are covered by Dr. Neeraj Kumar and coding tutorials by Ruchika Verma.

We used Python 3.7 to code these algorithms.
