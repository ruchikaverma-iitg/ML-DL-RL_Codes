[Dr. Neeraj Kumar](https://neerajkumarvaid.weebly.com/) - He develops machine learning algorithms (DL, traditional ML algorithms, Computer Vision, and NLP) to solve research problems at the intersection of computational pathology, medical image analysis, healthcare, and genomic data analysis. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (specializing in machine learning) and is skilled in popular machine/deep learning libraries.

[Ruchika Verma](https://ruchika-verma.weebly.com/) - She develops data-driven solutions using machine and deep learning to solve impactful problems in healthcare and medicine. She has been working on medical image processing and computational pathology to solve various problems including tumor nuclei segmentation, identifiction of co-existence of multiple sub-types of breast cancer, and survival prediction of Glioblastoma patients. Currently, she is pursuing Ph.D. at Case Western Reserve University and completed her masters in IIT Guwahati with specializing in statistical signal processing and machine learning.
